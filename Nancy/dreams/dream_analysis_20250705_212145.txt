DREAM NARRATIVE:
I'm in our house, but it's not quite our house. It's…older, more run-down. The walls are peeling, and there's a constant drip, drip, drip coming from the ceiling. I try to find the source, but it's everywhere. Zack is there, but he's…distant. He's sitting at the kitchen table with a half-empty glass of scotch, staring blankly. I ask him to help me find the leak, but he just shrugs and says, 'It's always leaked.' Cindy is crawling around in the puddles, giggling. Alice is there too, she is changing Cindy's diaper, which keeps leaking all over the floor. I try to grab Cindy, but my arms feel heavy, and I can't reach her. Alice laughs, a high-pitched, mocking laugh. Then, I'm at school, taking a test I haven't studied for. The questions are all about plumbing and leaky pipes. I don't understand any of it. The professor walks by and says, 'You'll never fix it, Nancy. It's always leaked.' The school then turns into our house and the ceiling gets even more leaky. I run to Zack and ask for help, but he won't even look at me.

PSYCHOANALYTIC INTERPRETATION:
This dream represents the dynamic interplay of unconscious signifiers,
the emergence of repressed content, and the subject's relationship
to object a (the cause of desire) as structured by their symptom.
