I'm the one who's always there for Cindy, who takes care of her, who loves her unconditionally. Not them, not Zack's family. They just want to control everything and everyone. (tearfully) And what about Zack? Is he just going to stand by and let them do this? Doesn't he trust me? Doesn't he know that I would never hurt our daughter? (bitterly) I guess not. I guess he's just going to side with his family like he always does. (pausing, taking a deep breath) Fine. If they want to play it that way, then let's do it. Let's go to court, let's get a lawyer. I'll show them what a good mother looks like. I'll fight for my daughter, and I'll win. (defiantly) They're not taking Cindy away from me.No one is taking my child away from me, don't you think?.",
